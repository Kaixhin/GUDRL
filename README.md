[All You Need Is Supervised Learning: From Imitation Learning to Meta-RL With Upside Down RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11960)

Implementation of a generalised UDRL agent. Supports online RL, imitation learning, offline RL, goal-conditioned RL, and meta-RL:
```sh
python main.py --mode [online|imitation|offline|goal|meta]
```

Note that some implementation decisions were made for simplicity, and hence do not reflect an implementation that works across all modes simultaneously.

Requirements
------------

Requirements can be installed with:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
